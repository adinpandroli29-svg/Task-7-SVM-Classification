Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Objective:
To implement SVM for linear and non-linear classification.

Dataset Used:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (loaded from sklearn.datasets).

Tools Used:

> Python

> NumPy

> Scikit-learn

> Matplotlib

Steps Performed:

> Loaded and prepared dataset for binary classification

> Standardized features

> Trained SVM with Linear kernel

> Trained SVM with RBF kernel

> Tuned hyperparameters (C and gamma)

> Evaluated using accuracy and cross-validation

> Visualized decision boundary

Conclusion:
SVM effectively maximizes margin between classes. The RBF kernel handles non-linear patterns better than linear kernel, and proper hyperparameter tuning improves performance.
